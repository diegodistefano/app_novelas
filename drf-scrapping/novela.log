2025-08-02 13:13:19,027 - INFO - Enviando a LibreTranslate: {'q': 'It was getting late, the street lights flickered around while someone coughed in the distance. The wind howled while people were trying to get to their homes. Little drops of water started appearing on the glass windows, followed by gentle tapping. A certain man was sitting in a lit room, holding what looked to be a soldering iron.\n\nHis hair was slightly unkempt and you could see a reflection of some kind of schematic coming of the glasses he was wearing. He was glancing between this schematic and the circuit board that was on the table.\n\n"I need to replace these capacitors, not sure which one is the faulty one, I\'ll just replace all of them."\n\nThe man gave out a sigh while slowly getting his tools ready. He was glancing onto the circuit board with the help of a microscope, the tiny metallic parts hard to spot with the naked eye.\n\n"That bastard made me work over-time again"\n\nThis man was in his mid-twenties, he was at a small computer repair shop. He was yet again forced to stay late into the day, being the \'new kid\' in this place apparently put a bullseye on your back. The older workers always found a way to push their overdue workload on him, always giving him the excuse that he needed more experience and he should work harder.\n\n"Damn fuckers only do this shit because I can\'t refuse."\n\nHe was still new, he was still in his trial period so he was expendable. He made the decision of trying to get along with his co-workers and play the nice guy. This was the result, he was stuck working and would probably be home at eight.\n\n"Well, not like I have any plans anyway..."\n\n"At least they don\'t force me to clean all those dirty laptops, what do those people do with them to get them so dirty anyway..."\n\nThe sound of sizzling filled the area while the man continued with his work. The capacitors were replaced and everything was checked again, the circuit board he was fixing was in working order once more.\n\n"Finally, just need to clean this shit and I\'m done."\n\nHe wasn\'t alone here though, the whole repair shop was the building that his boss was actually living in. The bottom level was just the shop while the upper was the living quarters. He peeked through the door leading upstairs and shouted out.\n\n"I\'m done, I\'m going home boss."\n\nHe heard some kind of grunt that was muffled by the sounds of a TV. He just shrugged and grabbed his coat to go, luckily he took his umbrella today. The moment he walked outside he was hit with a sudden gust of wind that almost snapped it in half though.\n\n"God damn if I left normally, I wouldn\'t be stuck in this damn storm."\n\nHe kicked a pebble while his umbrella shook from the pouring rain and strong winds. He felt dejected with his whole situation but not like he could do anything about it. He was living alone and needed it to pay rent, he barely had enough for an internet connection and food and was living from paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\'Ugh, If I ever get out of this shit hole I\'m going to open my own store, working for others sucks\'\n\nHe arrived at a crosswalk, the howling wind was smashing into his face and the lack of earphones and music to listen too was making this whole ordeal even harder to last through. The only thing making him power through this was the warm bed waiting at home. While his mind was elsewhere the light at the crosswalk turned green and he took a step forward.\n\nLuck wasn\'t on his side yet again. When he was about halfway across the street a large truck appeared out of nowhere. He looked to the shining halogen lights that blinded him momentarily. The vehicle came right at him, his mind went blank and his life flashed through his eyes.\n\nHe remembered his youth, his family, and his lack of friends. It was a life of mediocrity, a life of following the status quo. But then, suddenly he snapped out of it. His body jolted forward as he jumped for his dear life. He felt air pressure from his back accompanied by a large splash of water.\n\nHe tumbled forward onto the sidewalk, the large truck just continuing on as if nothing happened. He didn\'t even have time to glance at the plates. He was drenched in the rainwater, his hands scraped from the pavement.\n\n\'Fucking psycho!\'\n\nHe cursed while standing up, his palms were bloody and he was all wet, but luckily he was alive. His umbrella was in the middle of that street, flattened by the truck that almost killed him. His heart was pounding and he needed some time to calm down, but the pouring rain was making things hard.\n\n\'I need to get home...\'\n\nHe turned around while gritting his teeth, the fear replaced by anger as he headed home. He was drenched, his body was hurting and he still wasn\'t back home. There was a possibility that he could catch a cold, the only thing on his mind now was to take a warm shower.\n\n\'Sometimes I wish I could afford a bathtub... It always comes down to money...\'\n\nHe moved forward, his apartment wasn\'t far away from where he worked. This was the only saving grace of his job, he could reach it on foot withing thirty minutes which saved him some money.\n\nSuddenly he felt a shiver run down his spine, it wasn\'t the cold rain but more of a premonition. He could hear an engine revving not too far away from where he was. He slowly turned around, his eyes bulging slightly as he saw the exact same truck that almost turned him to meat paste.\n\n"What?"\n\nThe truck was progressively getting louder, its front lights turned off. By instinct he started backing away, the halogens turned on and shone at the street that he was in. There were buildings on both sides and no space to duck to the side. When the truck that had it in for him took off so did he, running for his life like never before.\n\n"Holy shit! Who is this fucker!"\n\nHe bolted forward, there was no one beside him in the streets no other cars in sight besides the honking truck behind him. The street was eerily empty, only one scrawny man running away from a big truck that went faster and faster.\n\n"I need to call the police, where is everyone!"\n\nHe continued running, his gaze focused on the end of the street a small alleyway there. He didn\'t look back, he didn\'t falter as he just kept running mustering everything that his gamer body could muster. With a last-ditch effort, he dived forward, a gust of wind felt behind him as the truck barreled past him while he jumped into the narrow passage.\n\nHe landed on his face, his hands getting scraped even more and blood running out of his nose. He quickly rolled up, trying to see if he was safe, the truck vanishing seemingly into thin air after clipping part of the building that connected to this alleyway.\n\n"Fuck, it shouldn\'t be able to get me here... but what if the driver chases after me instead?"\n\nHe was sweating bullets, tired, and afraid. This wasn\'t over, he didn\'t think so. He turned around and quickly escaped into the alleyway, nothing in it besides trash and rats. He jogged forward, exhausted from the previous sprint.\n\n"The other side... there is a police station on the other side!"\n\nHe saw the light at the end of the tunnel, not far from here there was a small police unit. He only needed to get there and report this fucker and everything. But as he was treading forward, the lights in the vicinity started to flicker continuously. Abruptly all of the light bulbs that lighted the way forward shattered into pieces and everything went dark and then he heard it again, the revving of the engine.\n\n"N-no... stay away..."\n\nIn front he could see the damn truck, it was barely able to fit into this narrow passage scraping the walls as it slowly drove forward. He quickly turned away, to his surprise he heard the same engine noise, another truck blocking his path was there too. The area filled with the screeching noise of scraping metal as the two trucks drove at him, each second increasing in speed.\n\n"Ha Ha Ha..."\n\nHe started laughing, his face showing a shaky smile as he lost it. He looked to the sides, walls blocking his path of escape.\n\n"Screw you!"\n\nHe moved to the wall, his fingers digging into the hard concrete wall as he tried climbing up. His fingernails broke, blood gushing out as he scratch trying to climb up, but to no avail, as the rainwater made it far too slippery. The last things that he saw, were the bright truck lights coming from the sides, he tried looking into the driver seat. His eyes bulging, his jaw clenched as he tried to see the person responsible. To his surprise, he didn\'t see anything, not even a silhouette of a driver the truck seat totally empty.\n\n*SPLAT!*\n\nThat was the last thing that he saw, his short life of a computer repairman ended right there. He felt resentment in his eyes, there were things that he wanted to achieve. Simple things, like a business of his own where he could dictate the rules and not be a slave to his wage for the rest of his life. But he was also looking at the bright side, he was now free, free from the worldly problems.\n\nHe floated in the void, his mind racing as it couldn\'t comprehend where it was. This state of mind didn\'t last for long as he felt being drawn somewhere. It was as if, something or someone was calling him there.\n\n"R....d.....m...........nd...."\n\nHe heard a voice, it was a gentle sounding voice that belonged to a woman.\n\n"Mas......R.land...."\n\n"Pl.as....you...mu..wak.......p...."\n\nHe felt strange like his whole being was getting pulled somewhere. He continuously heard the voice, it was calling out to him but he didn\'t recall the name that the woman was saying.\n\n\'Roland?\'\n\nThe voice that seemed distant started getting closer and he started feeling nauseous and tired. The only saving grace this time around, he felt something. He tried moving but his body felt sluggish, he could barely wiggle his finger.\n\n"H-he... he moved! Master Roland moved, oh thank the gods!"\n\nHe felt sick like he was having a really bad case of the flue. His head was spinning and his body felt heavy.\n\n"Did I survive those trucks? Is someone called Roland with me in here, is this the hospital?"\n\nHe couldn\'t see well, his eyes felt just as heavy as his body. He forced them open, they took a while to focus. The blurry world started taking shape and he saw an unfamiliar looking wooden ceiling.\n\n\'That looks shabby... am I in some kind of shed or something?\'\n\nHe finally saw the woman that was previously shouting. She looked like an older lady, her body was somewhat wrinkled up. The thing that caught his eye the most was what she was wearing.\n\n\'I-is that a maid uniform?\'\n\nShe was wearing the whole shebang. A black dress, a white apron, and a cap of some sort that was holding her hair. He felt something cool be placed on his forehead, which was a damp cloth that this lady placed. From the looks of it, he was still alive but ended up in someone\'s house instead of a hospital.\n\nThe strange thing was that the lady looked kind of big, was she over two meters tall or something. The bed he was in also seamed to be uncharacteristically large compared to his body. The problem wasn\'t with the furniture or the old woman though, as he leaned down he noticed that his body looked a lot different than before, for one he was a lot shorter.\n\nHe felt really weak and couldn\'t move, the woman that looked like a Victorian maid tended to his sick body. Not long after some kind of old man walked into the room. He looked to be some kind of physician, but for some reason, he didn\'t even give him an examination. He just stared at him while holding onto a monocle.\n\n\'Wait... why is that monocle glowing?\'\n\nThe man harrumphed while turning to the maid that was standing in the corner, visible concern on her face.\n\n"Why did you call me here, he is fine, his status is already recovering, don\'t call me for trivial things, I need to tend to the other young masters!"\n\nThe old man shouted at the maid as if she did something wrong. The old woman just bowed and took the verbal abuse, but the moment he left her face looked a lot brighter.\n\n"Thank the gods young master, you had me worried sick."\n\nShe smiled while replacing the damp wet cloth for a new one. She didn\'t stay there for long though, saying that he should sleep for now and that she would be back in a couple of hours to check on him.\n\nAfter the coast was clear, Roland managed to raise his upper body. He looked at his hands, they were soft and small. His body looked thin and slightly malnourished but that wasn\'t the main problem here.\n\n\'W-what is this? Did I become a kid?\'\n\nEverything in this room wasn\'t big, he just was small. He had turned into a child for some reason.\n\n\'Wait... am I really this Roland? ... what is this, what\'s going on... who is this... where is this...my status is recovering?\'\n\nWhile he was desperately clamoring for answers in his head something happened, a screen popped up in front of his face. His eyes bulged wide as he started reading what was written there. This wasn\'t all, the moment the window popped up he felt information rushing into his brain. It was as if thousands of needles poking his head, the information that he was receiving concerned the boy named Roland Arden that he was occupying the body of.\n\n"So that\'s how it is..."\n\nName :\tRoland Arden\nStrength\t4\nAgility\t5\nDexterity\t15\nVitality\t4\nEndurance\t4\nIntelligence\t35\nWillpower\t18\nCharisma\t6\nLuck\t5', 'source': 'en', 'target': 'es', 'format': 'text'}
2025-08-02 13:13:19,047 - INFO - Respuesta 200: {"translatedText":"Se estaba haciendo tarde, las luces de la calle parpadeaban mientras alguien tosía a la distancia. El viento aulló mientras la gente intentaba llegar a sus hogares. Pocos gotas de agua comenzaron a aparecer en las ventanas de vidrio, seguidos de suaves tapping. Un hombre estaba sentado en una habitación iluminada, sosteniendo lo que parecía ser un soldador de hierro.\n\nSu cabello estaba un poco desenfrenado y se podía ver un reflejo de algún tipo de acercamiento esquemático de las gafas que llevaba puesto. Estaba reluciente entre este esquema y el circuito que estaba sobre la mesa.\n\n\"Necesito reemplazar a estos condensadores, no estoy seguro de cuál es el culpable, sólo reemplazaré a todos.\"\n\nEl hombre dio un suspiro mientras lentamente preparaba sus herramientas. Estaba mirando hacia la tabla de circuitos con la ayuda de un microscopio, las pequeñas piezas metálicas difíciles de detectar con el ojo desnudo.\n\n\"Ese bastardo me hizo trabajar horas extras de nuevo\"\n\nEste hombre estaba a mediados de los años veinte, estaba en una pequeña tienda de reparaciones. Una vez más se vio obligado a quedarse hasta tarde, siendo el \"nuevo niño\" en este lugar, aparentemente puso una bala en la espalda. Los trabajadores mayores siempre encontraron una manera de empujar su carga de trabajo atrasada en él, siempre dándole la excusa de que necesitaba más experiencia y que debía trabajar más duro.\n\n\"Los malditos solo hacen esta mierda porque no puedo negarme\".\n\nTodavía era nuevo, todavía estaba en su período de prueba así que era prescindible. Tomó la decisión de intentar llevarse bien con sus compañeros de trabajo y jugar al buen tipo. Este fue el resultado, estaba atrapado trabajando y probablemente estaría en casa a las ocho.\n\n\"Bueno, no como si tuviera planes...\"\n\n\"Al menos no me obligan a limpiar todos esos portátiles sucios, ¿qué hacen esas personas con ellos para ensuciarlos de todos modos...\"\n\nEl sonido de sizzling llenó la zona mientras el hombre continuaba con su trabajo. Los condensadores fueron reemplazados y todo fue revisado de nuevo, el tablero de circuito que estaba arreglando estaba en orden de trabajo una vez más.\n\n\"Finalmente, sólo necesito limpiar esta mierda y he terminado.\"\n\nPero no estaba solo aquí, toda la tienda de reparaciones era el edificio en el que su jefe vivía. El nivel inferior era sólo la tienda mientras que la parte superior era los cuartos de estar. Miró por la puerta y gritó.\n\n\"He terminado, me voy a casa jefe.\"\n\nOyó algún tipo de gruñido que fue desconcertado por los sonidos de una televisión. Sólo arrancó y cogió su abrigo para ir, por suerte tomó su paraguas hoy. En el momento en que salió fue golpeado con una repentina ráfaga de viento que casi lo rompió en la mitad.\n\n\"Maldita sea si me fuera normalmente, no estaría atrapado en esta maldita tormenta.\"\n\nPateó un guijarro mientras su paraguas se sacudía de la lluvia derramante y vientos fuertes. Se sintió deprimido con toda su situación pero no como si pudiera hacer algo al respecto. Vivía solo y lo necesitaba para pagar alquiler, apenas tenía suficiente para una conexión a Internet y comida y vivía de pago a pago.\n\n'Ugh, Si alguna vez salgo de este agujero de mierda voy a abrir mi propia tienda, trabajar para otros apesta '\n\nLlegó a un cruce de caminos, el viento aullido se golpeó en su cara y la falta de auriculares y música para escuchar también estaba haciendo este ordeal entero aún más difícil de durar. Lo único que le hizo poder a través de esto fue la cama caliente esperando en casa. Mientras su mente estaba en otro lugar la luz en el cruce se volvió verde y dio un paso adelante.\n\nLa suerte no estaba de su lado otra vez. Cuando estaba cerca de la mitad de la calle apareció un camión grande de la nada. Miró a las brillantes luces halógenas que le cegó momentáneamente. El vehículo se acercó a él, su mente se quedó en blanco y su vida parpadeó a través de sus ojos.\n\nRecordó su juventud, su familia y su falta de amigos. Era una vida de mediocridad, una vida de seguir el status quo. Pero entonces, de repente se salió de ella. Su cuerpo corrió hacia adelante mientras saltaba por su querida vida. Sentía presión del aire de su espalda acompañada de un gran chorro de agua.\n\nSe abalanzaba hacia la acera, el camión grande continuaba como si nada pasara. Ni siquiera tenía tiempo para echar un vistazo a los platos. Estaba empapado en el agua de lluvia, sus manos rasgadas del pavimento.\n\n¡Psicótico de mierda! '\n\nMaldijo mientras estaba de pie, sus palmas estaban sangrientas y estaba todo mojado, pero por suerte estaba vivo. Su paraguas estaba en medio de esa calle, aplanada por el camión que casi lo mata. Su corazón estaba golpeando y necesitaba algo de tiempo para calmarse, pero la lluvia derramante estaba haciendo las cosas difíciles.\n\nNecesito volver a casa... '\n\nSe dio la vuelta mientras se rechinaba los dientes, el miedo reemplazado por la ira mientras se dirigía a casa. Estaba empapado, su cuerpo estaba herido y todavía no estaba de vuelta a casa. Había una posibilidad de que él pudiera tomar un resfriado, lo único en su mente ahora era tomar una ducha caliente.\n\nA veces desearía poder pagar una bañera... Siempre se reduce al dinero... '\n\nSe movió hacia adelante, su apartamento no estaba lejos de donde trabajaba. Esta fue la única gracia salvadora de su trabajo, él pudo alcanzarla a pie con treinta minutos que le salvaron algo de dinero.\n\nDe repente sintió que un tirón corría por su columna, no era la lluvia fría sino más de una premonición. Podía oír un motor reviviendo no muy lejos de donde estaba. Poco a poco se dio la vuelta, sus ojos abultándose ligeramente mientras veía el mismo camión que casi lo volvía a la pasta de carne.\n\n\"¿Qué?\"\n\nEl camión estaba aumentando progresivamente, sus luces delanteras apagadas. Por instinto comenzó a retroceder, los halógenos se encendieron y brillaron en la calle en la que estaba. Había edificios en ambos lados y no había espacio para patear al costado. Cuando el camión que lo tenía se lo quitó, así que corrió por su vida como nunca antes.\n\n\"¡Joder! ¡Quién es este cabrón!\"\n\nSe adelantó, no había nadie a su lado en las calles no había otros coches a la vista además del camión de caza detrás de él. La calle estaba muy vacía, sólo un hombre asqueroso huyendo de un camión grande que fue más rápido y más rápido.\n\n\"¡Necesito llamar a la policía, donde están todos!\"\n\nContinuó corriendo, su mirada se centró en el final de la calle un pequeño callejón allí. No miró hacia atrás, no faltó mientras seguía corriendo desgarrando todo lo que su cuerpo de jugador podía ser más pesado. Con un esfuerzo de último punto, se zambulló hacia adelante, una ráfaga de viento se sentía detrás de él mientras el camión lo pasaba mientras saltaba al estrecho paso.\n\nAterrizó en su cara, se le rasgó las manos aún más y se le acabó la sangre de la nariz. Rápidamente se enrolló, tratando de ver si estaba a salvo, el camión se desvaneció aparentemente en el aire delgado después de cortar parte del edificio que conectaba con este callejón.\n\n\"Mierda, no debería poder traerme aquí... pero ¿y si el conductor me persigue?\"\n\nEstaba sudando balas, cansado y asustado. Esto no terminó, no lo pensó. Se dio la vuelta y rápidamente escapó al callejón, nada más que basura y ratas. Corrió hacia adelante, agotado de la huella anterior.\n\n\"¡El otro lado... hay una estación de policía en el otro lado!\"\n\nVio la luz al final del túnel, no lejos de aquí había una pequeña unidad policial. Sólo necesitaba llegar y reportar a este cabrón y todo. Pero mientras caminaba hacia delante, las luces de la vecindad comenzaron a flicker continuamente. Abruptly todas las bombillas que iluminaron el camino hacia adelante se destrozaron en pedazos y todo se oscureció y luego lo escuchó de nuevo, la revitalización del motor.\n\n\"N-no... aléjate...\"\n\nEn frente podía ver el maldito camión, apenas era capaz de encajar en este estrecho pasaje raspando las paredes mientras lentamente hacia adelante. Rápidamente se volvió, para su sorpresa escuchó el mismo ruido del motor, otro camión que bloqueaba su camino también estaba allí. El área llenada con el ruido desgarrador de metal a medida que los dos camiones le condujeron, cada segundo aumentando en velocidad.\n\n\"Ha Ha Ha...\"\n\nComenzó a reírse, su cara mostrando una sonrisa agitada mientras lo perdió. Miró a los lados, las paredes bloqueando su camino de escape.\n\n\"¡Vete a la mierda!\"\n\nSe mudó a la pared, sus dedos cavando en la pared de hormigón duro mientras intentaba subir. Sus uñas se rompieron, la sangre brotando mientras se rascaba tratando de subir, pero sin ningún motivo, como el agua de lluvia lo hizo demasiado resbaladizo. Las últimas cosas que vio, eran las luces de camiones brillantes que venían de los lados, trató de mirar en el asiento del conductor. Sus ojos abultados, su mandíbula apretada mientras trataba de ver a la persona responsable. Para su sorpresa, él no vio nada, ni siquiera una silueta de un conductor el asiento del camión totalmente vacío.\n\n*SPLAT*\n\nEso fue lo último que vio, su corta vida de un reparador de computadora terminó allí. Sentía resentimiento en sus ojos, había cosas que quería lograr. Cosas simples, como un negocio propio donde podría dictar las reglas y no ser esclavo de su salario por el resto de su vida. Pero también estaba mirando el lado brillante, ahora estaba libre, libre de los problemas mundanos.\n\nFlotó en el vacío, su mente corriendo como no podía comprender dónde estaba. Este estado de ánimo no duró mucho tiempo mientras se sentía dibujado en alguna parte. Era como si algo o alguien lo llamara allí.\n\n\"R....d... ..m... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..\n\nOyó una voz, era una suave voz sonora que pertenecía a una mujer.\n\n\"Mas... R.land...\"\n\n\"Pl.as... tu...mu.wak....p....\"\n\nSe sentía extraño como si todo su ser estuviera siendo tirado a algún lado. Oyó continuamente la voz, le llamaba, pero no recordaba el nombre que la mujer decía.\n\n¿Roland? '\n\nLa voz que parecía distante empezó a acercarse y empezó a sentirse náusea y cansada. La única gracia salvadora en este momento, sintió algo. Intentó moverse, pero su cuerpo se sentía espeluznante, apenas podía mover el dedo.\n\n¡Se movió! El Maestro Roland se movió, ¡oh gracias a los dioses!\"\n\nSe sentía enfermo como si estuviera teniendo un mal caso de gripe. Su cabeza giraba y su cuerpo se sentía pesado.\n\n\"¿He sobrevivido a esos camiones? ¿Alguien llamado Roland conmigo aquí, es este el hospital?\"\n\nNo podía ver bien, sus ojos se sentían tan pesados como su cuerpo. Los obligó a abrirse, tardaron un tiempo en concentrarse. El mundo borroso comenzó a tomar forma y vio un techo de madera de aspecto desconocido.\n\n' Eso se ve sombrío... ¿Estoy en algún tipo de cobertizo o algo así? '\n\nFinalmente vio a la mujer que había gritado. Parecía una señora mayor, su cuerpo estaba algo arrugado. Lo que más le sorprendió era lo que llevaba puesto.\n\n¿Es un uniforme de mucama? '\n\nLlevaba todo el shebang. Un vestido negro, un delantal blanco y una gorra de algún tipo que tenía el pelo. Sentía algo guay ser colocado en su frente, que era un paño húmedo que esta señora puso. Por lo que parece, todavía estaba vivo pero terminó en la casa de alguien en lugar de un hospital.\n\nLo extraño era que la señora parecía algo grande, era ella de más de dos metros de altura o algo así. La cama en la que también estaba sellado para ser incaracterísticamente grande en comparación con su cuerpo. El problema no estaba con los muebles o la anciana, sin embargo, mientras se inclinaba notó que su cuerpo parecía mucho más diferente que antes, para uno era mucho más corto.\n\nSe sentía muy débil y no podía moverse, la mujer que parecía una criada victoriana tendía a su cuerpo enfermo. No mucho después de que un viejo entrara en la habitación. Parecía un médico, pero por alguna razón, ni siquiera le hizo un examen.

There were buildings on both sides and no space to duck to the side. When the truck that had it in for him took off so did he, running for his life like never before. "Holy shit!

He bolted forward, there was no one beside him in the streets no other cars in sight besides the honking truck behind him. The street was eerily empty, only one scrawny man running away from a big truck that went faster and faster. "I need to call the police, where is everyone!"

He arrived at a crosswalk, the howling wind was smashing into his face and the lack of earphones and music to listen too was making this whole ordeal even harder to last through.

Luck wasn't on his side yet again.

He continued running, his gaze focused on the end of the street a small alleyway there.

In front he could see the damn truck, it was barely able to fit into this narrow passage scraping the walls as it slowly drove forward. He quickly turned away, to his surprise he heard the same engine noise, another truck blocking his path was there too.

He started laughing, his face showing a shaky smile as he lost it.

His fingernails broke, blood gushing out as he scratch trying to climb up, but to no avail, as the rainwater made it far too slippery.

He bolted forward, there was no one beside him in the streets no other cars in sight besides the honking truck behind him. The street was eerily empty, only one scrawny man running away from a big truck that went faster and faster. "I need to call the police, where is everyone!"

He continued running, his gaze focused on the end of the street a small alleyway there.

He moved to the wall, his fingers digging into the hard concrete wall as he tried climbing up. His fingernails broke, blood gushing out as he scratch trying to climb up, but to no avail, as the rainwater made it far too slippery. The last things that he saw, were the bright truck lights coming from the sides, he tried looking into the driver seat. His eyes bulging, his jaw clenched as he tried to see the person responsible.

Simple things, like a business of his own where he could dictate the rules and not be a slave to his wage for the rest of his life.

He felt sick like he was having a really bad case of the flue. His head was spinning and his body felt heavy. "Did I survive those trucks? Is someone called Roland with me in here, is this the hospital?"

He finally saw the woman that was previously shouting. She looked like an older lady, her body was somewhat wrinkled up. The thing that caught his eye the most was what she was wearing. 'I-is that a maid uniform?'

She was wearing the whole shebang. A black dress, a white apron, and a cap of some sort that was holding her hair. He felt something cool be placed on his forehead, which was a damp cloth that this lady placed.

The problem wasn't with the furniture or the old woman though, as he leaned down he noticed that his body looked a lot different than before, for one he was a lot shorter.

The man gave out a sigh while slowly getting his tools ready. He was glancing onto the circuit board with the help of a microscope, the tiny metallic parts hard to spot with the naked eye. "That bastard made me work over-time again"

This man was in his mid-twenties, he was at a small computer repair shop.

He heard some kind of grunt that was muffled by the sounds of a TV. He just shrugged and grabbed his coat to go, luckily he took his umbrella today.

He kicked a pebble while his umbrella shook from the pouring rain and strong winds.

He arrived at a crosswalk, the howling wind was smashing into his face and the lack of earphones and music to listen too was making this whole ordeal even harder to last through. The only thing making him power through this was the warm bed waiting at home. While his mind was elsewhere the light at the crosswalk turned green and he took a step forward. Luck wasn't on his side yet again.

He continued running, his gaze focused on the end of the street a small alleyway there.

He started laughing, his face showing a shaky smile as he lost it.

He felt strange like his whole being was getting pulled somewhere. He continuously heard the voice, it was calling out to him but he didn't recall the name that the woman was saying. 'Roland?'

The voice that seemed distant started getting closer and he started feeling nauseous and tired. The only saving grace this time around, he felt something. He tried moving but his body felt sluggish, he could barely wiggle his finger. "H-he...

He felt sick like he was having a really bad case of the flue. His head was spinning and his body felt heavy. "Did I survive those trucks? Is someone called Roland with me in here, is this the hospital?"

He couldn't see well, his eyes felt just as heavy as his body. He forced them open, they took a while to focus. The blurry world started taking shape and he saw an unfamiliar looking wooden ceiling. 'That looks shabby...

He finally saw the woman that was previously shouting. She looked like an older lady, her body was somewhat wrinkled up. The thing that caught his eye the most was what she was wearing. 'I-is that a maid uniform?'

She was wearing the whole shebang. A black dress, a white apron, and a cap of some sort that was holding her hair. He felt something cool be placed on his forehead, which was a damp cloth that this lady placed.

The strange thing was that the lady looked kind of big, was she over two meters tall or something. The bed he was in also seamed to be uncharacteristically large compared to his body. The problem wasn't with the furniture or the old woman though, as he leaned down he noticed that his body looked a lot different than before, for one he was a lot shorter.

Not long after some kind of old man walked into the room. He looked to be some kind of physician, but for some reason, he didn't even give him an examination. He just stared at him while holding onto a monocle. 'Wait... why is that monocle glowing?'

The man harrumphed while turning to the maid that was standing in the corner, visible concern on her face.

The old man shouted at the maid as if she did something wrong. The old woman just bowed and took the verbal abuse, but the moment he left her face looked a lot brighter. "Thank the gods young master, you had me worried sick."

She smiled while replacing the damp wet cloth for a new one.

While he was desperately clamoring for answers in his head something happened, a screen popped up in front of his face. His eyes bulged wide as he started reading what was written there. This wasn't all, the moment the window popped up he felt information rushing into his brain.

The truck was progressively getting louder, its front lights turned off. By instinct he started backing away, the halogens turned on and shone at the street that he was in.

He continued running, his gaze focused on the end of the street a small alleyway there.

He quickly turned away, to his surprise he heard the same engine noise, another truck blocking his path was there too. The area filled with the screeching noise of scraping metal as the two trucks drove at him, each second increasing in speed. "Ha Ha Ha..."

He started laughing, his face showing a shaky smile as he lost it.

The problem wasn't with the furniture or the old woman though, as he leaned down he noticed that his body looked a lot different than before, for one he was a lot shorter.
